The content of text nodes (either HTML or graphs) depends on the type of the object being displayed. A format string
will be used to describe this format. The format string is a "normal" string, with data inserted at points specified
using curly brackets ({}) in one of the following formats:

{{}: Print a literal "{"
{}}: Print a literal "}"
{varname}: Display the variable name literally (based on its type).
{fun:varname}: Call a function (listed below) on the varname, and include its return value.
{fun:varname,arg}: As above, but supply the argument to the function as well (if needed).

The accepted functions are as follows:
link: Creates a HTML hyperlink for the variable. Email addresses will use a "mailto:" link.
singleline: Trims all but the first line from a multiline text field.
cap: Removes all characters after the position specified by the argument, should the string be longer than that.
cape: As cap, but if the string is longer, the last three characters are replaced with "." (elipses).
dformat: Formats the provided date given the argument. The argument is a format string described at

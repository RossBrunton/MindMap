Each field for an object type has a type, as follows:

text: A single line of text.

blockText: Multiple lines of text. This will use a multiline text box rather than a single line one in the editor.

url: A URL, the editor will validate this.

email: An email address, the editor will also validate this.

date: A full datetime. When written to the JSON objects file, this will be in Date.toJSON() format (ISO 8601). For ease
of use, internally these will be stored as strings rather than JS Date objects. The argument to this type (that is, the
third entry in it's list) is one of the following: "year", "month", "day", "minute" describing how granular the editor 
will treat it (anything more specific than the argument will be absent from the editing of this field).
